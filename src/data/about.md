# Intro

Hello, my name is Jimmy. It's nice to meet you.

It is difficult to come up with an adequate introduction for myself, but I'll try to give you a few important details about me. I was born and raised in Fishers, Indiana as the youngest of five children: Elly, Brian, Andy, Zack, and Allie. Growing up, I was extremely extroverted and curious about the world. I remember from a young age wanting to learn as much as I could, especially if it involved math, and constantly pestering my teachers with fun facts - at least they were fun to me!  

Growing up with so many talented, athletic siblings, I was heavily involved in sports as a child with some of my favorites being wrestling, lacrosse, and football. By the time I was in high school, I had realized that math was my favorite subject and started to take as many courses as possible. Luckily, my wonderful high school allowed me to take advanced mathematics courses at the nearest college after I had completed all the available courses.  

When I was 18, my love for music, specifically the blues and electric guitar, started to blossom. I began learning the guitar and have not looked back since. I have the greatest affinity for the blues and still can't help but to make a "stank face" when I hear someone expressing themselves with a guitar. Some of my idols include Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Mayer, B.B. King, and Albert King.  

During college, I made the short road trip from Fishers to Columbus to attend The Ohio State University where I studied computer science. College was difficult to grasp at first but within a couple of semesters, I started to hit my stride and fall in love with learning again - especially at such a high level. My love for mathematics was satiated and my intertwined fondness of computer science began to form.  

After college, I quickly started my career as a software engineer in Richmond, Virginia. Aside from Richmond providing me with a means to support myself, Richmond also provided me proximity to the New River Gorge - a premier rock climbing destination where I became obsessed with the sport. Within a year of moving to Virginia, I started to make the four hour road trip to the New every weekend to rock climb with friends and rock climbing has sincerely given me some of the happiest times of my life. I enjoy computer science and software engineering but I believe the idea of retiring and living in a van so I can travel across the world and rock climb is my paramount motivation for success in my career.  

I hope that introduction was sufficient!
